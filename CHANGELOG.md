# Changelog

## [0.62.0-alpha.15] - 2026-06-14

Large parity push porting the remaining portable features from upstream jmux
(through v0.64.15), plus several UX additions and fixes.

### Added

- **Workspace groups** — collapsible sidebar sections with per-group color, unread badges, drag-to-reorder (drag a group header to relocate the whole block; drop a workspace onto a group to join it), session persistence, and `jmux group …` CLI / `workspace.group.*` socket commands
- **Diff viewer** — `jmux diff [path]` opens a git diff CodeView panel (colored add/remove/hunk lines, working-tree/staged toggle); plain-GTK, works without WebKit
- **Project visualizer** — `jmux project [path]` opens a structure pane (bounded directory tree + file-type summary)
- **Agent hibernation** — pause an idle agent (SIGSTOP its TTY's process group) to free CPU and resume on demand (SIGCONT); sidebar pause indicator, context menu, `jmux hibernate`/`wake`
- **Move tabs** — drag a tab onto another pane to move it; drag onto a pane edge to split (right/left → horizontal, bottom/top → vertical); or onto a sidebar workspace row to move it to another workspace
- **Reopen closed workspace** — `jmux reopen` / command palette restores the most recently closed workspace (layout + cwd, fresh shells)
- **Workspace focus history** — back/forward through recently-focused workspaces (`jmux back`/`jmux forward`, palette, `workspace.focus_back`/`forward`)
- **Fish shell integration** — full parity with the zsh/bash integration, injected via `XDG_DATA_DIRS` `vendor_conf.d`
- **SSH agent forwarding** — `jmux ssh -A` / dialog toggle (`ssh -A`)
- **Browser** — per-tab audio mute, focus mode, mouse back/forward side buttons (8/9), `react-grab` automation, configurable custom search engine, New Browser Workspace, omnibar first-click select-all
- **Display placement** — `jmux window displays` lists monitors; `jmux window display <name|index>` moves the window to a monitor (fullscreen-on-monitor)
- **Inline remote Reconnect** button on disconnected/errored remote workspace rows
- **Configurable sidebar font size**; markdown viewer zoom controls
- **App icon** shipped (`com.jacobbriggs.jmux`) and set as the window/taskbar icon
- `jmux help` now prints a proper grouped help menu instead of raw JSON

### Fixed

- **Active-pane highlight/dim** now updates on focus change without a full rebuild — previously only the first-built pane stayed bright
- **Starship bash prompt** no longer goes static — the integration restores the user command's exit code for chained `PROMPT_COMMAND` entries
- **Startup deadlock** in the workspace hibernation context menu (re-locked `tab_manager` while the sidebar already held it)

## [0.62.0-alpha.11] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- `jmux surface send-key` now correctly sends non-printable keys (Return, Escape, Tab, Backspace, Delete, Space, arrow keys, Home/End, Page Up/Down, Insert, F1–F12). Previously all special keys were silently dropped because the keycode was hardcoded to 0

## [0.62.0-alpha.10] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Right-click context menu on terminal panels with Copy and Paste actions

### Fixed

- **Browser panel stability** — browser panels no longer freeze, flicker, or reload when typing in a terminal or running commands. Shell integrations (title updates, directory changes) no longer trigger a full UI layout rebuild
- New terminals no longer display a stray `^L` character on the first prompt

## [0.62.0-alpha.9] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Remote SSH workspaces** — `jmux ssh user@host` connects to remote hosts with a full jmux workspace: auto-bootstrapped daemon (`jmuxd-remote`), SOCKS5 proxy tunnel for browser traffic, CLI relay for remote jmux commands, sidebar connection state indicators (Connecting / Connected / Disconnected / Error)
- Remote workspace connection health monitor with automatic reconnect on session restore
- Toast error notifications for remote workspace connection failures
- `persist_scrollback` setting (default: on) — when disabled, terminal scrollback is omitted from session snapshots entirely, preventing passwords and tokens from being written to disk

### Changed

- Socket auth modes reduced from 6 to 5 — removed `Password` mode (dead code, superseded by `SO_PEERCRED` same-UID check)
- Quit confirmation dialog now uses square corners to match the app's flat aesthetic

### Fixed

- **SSRF**: Proxy tunnel `proxy.open` now resolves hostnames and checks all resolved IPs against a CIDR denylist (loopback, link-local, RFC-1918, cloud metadata `169.254.169.254`). Set `JMUXD_PROXY_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` on the remote host to allow proxying to local dev servers
- **XSS**: HTTP interstitial "Proceed Anyway" button uses `data-href` + event listener instead of inline `onclick` — eliminates HTML/JS nested escaping context
- **RPC mutex safety**: JSON-RPC client recovers from mutex poison on bookkeeping maps; stdin mutex poison marks connection dead to prevent partial-write protocol corruption
- Block `javascript:` scheme in browser navigation allowlist
- Markdown panels: deny-all permission requests, open external HTTP(S) links in xdg-open, block all other external navigations
- Config directories created with explicit 0o700 permissions
- PID lockfile and remote daemon download temp files use O_EXCL creation to prevent symlink attacks
- Scrollback temp files cleaned up at session restore

## [0.62.0-alpha.8] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- Browser support is now optional — build without WebKit via `--no-default-features` for a lighter terminal-only binary
- Security documentation at `docs/security.md` covering threat model, authentication, and all hardening measures
- AGPL-3.0 license and CONTRIBUTING.md

### Changed

- Disable GLES and Vulkan GDK backends — forces desktop OpenGL for ghostty compatibility on all hardware
- License changed from MIT to AGPL-3.0-or-later

### Fixed

- Replace openssl subprocess with native Rust HMAC-SHA256 (`hmac` + `sha2` crates) — eliminates auth bypass when openssl is missing
- Fix JavaScript injection in browser `input_mouse`/`input_keyboard`/`input_touch` — event types now validated against whitelist
- Remove unnecessary `Sync` on FFI pointer wrappers (`SendSurfacePtr`, `SendAppPtr`)
- Validate `open_in.*` editor binary against hardcoded whitelist before execution
- Write browser profiles, settings, and shortcuts config files with 0o600 permissions
- Remove `sh -c` shell wrapper from remote daemon SSH invocation — pass args directly
- Cap proxy tunnel at 32 concurrent connections with panic-safe counter
- Sanitize terminal-sourced titles and directories (strip C0/C1 control chars before GTK display)
- Remove `JMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD` from environment at startup to prevent child process access
- Safe integer cast for SSH port numbers (`u16::try_from` instead of `as u16`)
- Restrict `xdg-open` deep links to whitelisted URL schemes
- Validate SSH options restored from session files (require `Key=Value` format)
- Validate notification sound file paths (known audio extensions + regular file check)
- Log SSH stderr instead of discarding it
- Warn prominently when `AllowAll` socket mode is active
- Enable integer overflow checks in release builds
- Add SAFETY comments to all unsafe blocks across FFI and libc calls

## [0.62.0-alpha.7] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- Fix AUR package build failure — GLAD now built as shared library to resolve `rust-lld` undefined reference errors (`gladLoaderLoadGLContext`, `gladLoaderUnloadGLContext`)

## [0.62.0-alpha.6] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

- Ghostty submodule switched to `douglas/ghostty` `jmux-linux-1.3.1` branch (upstream 1.3.1 + Linux embedded support, fully controlled)

### Fixed

- Fix shifted keys (`?`, `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.) not working in TUI apps like Claude Code and Codex — consumed modifiers now correctly reported to ghostty
- Fix shell integration `cur_head=` output corrupting TUI display — background subshells now redirect all output to `/dev/null`
- Fix session restore opening stale empty windows — workspaces with 0 panels are now filtered out

## [0.62.0-alpha.5] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

- Use upstream ghostty 1.3.1 with Linux embedded patch (ghostty-org/ghostty#11721) instead of manaflow fork — patch auto-applied at build time, removable when upstream merges

## [0.62.0-alpha.4] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- Switch ghostty submodule from manaflow-ai fork to upstream ghostty 1.3.1 stable (douglas/ghostty) — no fork-specific code remains

### Fixed

- Fix `?` and other shifted keys not working in Claude Code / Codex TUI (caused by manaflow ghostty fork key handling)
- Fix shell integration debug output (`cur_head=...`) leaking to terminal when Claude Code enables xtrace
- Fix GTK warnings about finalized ListBoxRow with leftover PopoverMenu children on sidebar refresh

## [0.62.0-alpha.3] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- GitHub Actions release workflow with automated AUR publishing on tag push
- `cargo-audit` security check in CI pipeline

## [0.62.0-alpha.2] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- Browser permissions (camera, microphone, geolocation) are now denied by default instead of auto-allowed

### Fixed

- Fix self-deadlock when opening sidebar context menu with multiple windows (caused socket commands to hang permanently)
- Fix stale socket preventing app restart after crash — PID lockfile detects dead processes automatically
- CLI retries transient connection failures (EAGAIN, ECONNREFUSED) with backoff instead of failing immediately
- Fix HTTP allowlist wildcard matching — `*.example.com` no longer incorrectly matches `notexample.com`
- Fix search URL parameter injection — special characters (`&`, `#`) now properly percent-encoded
- Prevent shell injection in SSH workspace creation and notification custom commands
- Prevent XSS in HTTP insecurity interstitial via single-quote escaping
- Prevent download filename path traversal via absolute paths
- Prevent browser profile name path traversal in create/rename/delete
- Browser eval and action-with-reply commands now time out after 30 seconds instead of hanging indefinitely
- Scrollback temp files moved to `~/.cache/jmux/scrollback/` with restrictive permissions (0o600) and symlink protection
- Browser history file written with 0o600 permissions (no longer world-readable)
- WebKit profile data/cache directories set to 0o700 permissions
- XDG_RUNTIME_DIR validation no longer follows symlinks
- Socket handler inputs hardened: ports array capped, TTY/directory strings truncated, priority cast uses safe conversion
- Console messages truncated to 64KB per entry, browser history capped to 50,000 entries on load
- URLs passed to xdg-open sanitized (control characters stripped, length capped)
- Weak HMAC in relay auth replaced with openssl HMAC-SHA256 (fail-closed)
- Remote module shell injection prevented at 5 sites via shell-escape

- **Notification system** — terminal OSC 9/777 triggers, desktop notifications, sound presets (freedesktop theme sounds + custom files), pane attention ring, unread badges
- **Settings UI** — theme (System/Light/Dark/Omarchy), sidebar display toggles, browser config (search engine, home URL, HTTP allowlist), keyboard shortcuts, link routing, notification sounds
- **Sidebar metadata** — git branch, PR status with CI checks, working directory, listening ports, log entries, progress bars, custom status pills, freeform markdown blocks
- **Multi-window** — Ctrl+Shift+N for new windows, per-window workspaces, cross-window workspace movement, geometry persistence

- **macOS command aliases** — browser commands accept both underscore (`browser.find_by_text`) and dot notation (`browser.find.text`) for cross-platform script parity
- **Configurable shortcuts** — all keyboard shortcuts customizable via ~/.config/jmux/shortcuts.json

### Fixed

- Browser WebViews now cached across layout rebuilds (no more grey panels or crashes when closing adjacent terminals)
- Navigation policy correctly handles `about:blank` scheme (no longer routes to system browser)
- Omnibar suggestion popover dismisses after page load (no more sticky dropdown)
- WebView shutdown cleanup prevents WebProcess segfault on app close
- Stale session restore filters empty windows to prevent invisible app launch
- Browser `open_split` socket command now properly sets initial URL
